    "The composite index I am creating is intended to indicate: “What makes a country more or less attractive to live in?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I am referring to a handbook on constructing composite indicators to guide the development of this (Dunn 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "This would include sub-indices for different groupings of factors, which I expect to be labelled after areas like \"healthcare\", \"transport\" or \"economy\". The resulting composite index can be compared to an existing indicator on World Bank's open database: \"Net Migration\" (The World Bank Group 2025), which is the amount of people who move into a country minus the amount of people who move out of a country.\n",

    "### Expert Opinion\n",
    "Expert opinion is invaluable for a project such as this, their feedback comes from experience within their area of expertise, giving a strong starting point for potentially signifigant features to include. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, I have considered the following contacts in an attempt to find such opinion(s):\n",
    "- Irish Department of Foreign Affairs *(initial email to establish connection has been sent)*\n",
    "- Embassies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Research\n",
    "I intend to conduct my own research, which is aimed at discovering and justifying features that may prove useful in the creation of the composite index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Ask an LLM for advice on factors that may be suitable for producing an index on country migration attractiveness.\n",
    "2. Create and observe a post on reddit, preferably on a subreddit about migration, which asks for reasons why people have moved to/from countries.\n",
    "3. Review findings from both sources, picking out the most frequently occuring factors.\n",
